This is a website which serves as a Twitter search engine for COVID-19 relief supplies.

It filters out the people who need the supplies on Twitter and only presents the verified leads from people who are supplying the relief materials. It has a simple to use UI, with an easy drop down featuring the most commonly searched items such as "Oxygen Cylinders", “Remdesivir Injections” etc. Along with its most important search engine facility, it also provides a navigation bar leading to various sections in the website such as the hashtag "#IndiaFightsCorona" which is a live feed of the latest tweets from India's official COVID-19 hashtag, an FAQs section, and a voluntary donation section.

Most people who are in an emergency, wouldn't be able to figure out how to use twitter's advanced searching facilities to get what they're looking for and would end up wasting precious time scrolling through pointless leads.

My website provides an easy, fully functioning search engine that only requires the user to enter the state and (optional) choose what they're looking for from our drop down, and completes the search for them by adding necessary keywords such as "verified" and negating words such as "need" "required" "looking for" etc. 
This ensures they get the best leads within seconds without having to go through multiple tweets also looking for aid.
